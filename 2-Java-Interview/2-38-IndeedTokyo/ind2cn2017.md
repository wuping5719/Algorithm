For beginners
If you take part in a programming contest for the first time which is held on AtCoder, 
we make a strong recommendation to you to practice how to submit your source code 
on AtCoder using Practice Page.
Especially, if you are going to use Java language, you must see points to notice bellow.
•	The class name of your source code has to declared as Main. 
Not to declared as main and any other class name. For this reason, 
the file name of yours also designated as Main.
•	You don't allow to use your package. 
Because the execution command on our system for Java is java {filename}.
________________________________________

Programming language
You are allowed to use these programming languages.

Judge status
Our system judges your source code whether it is correct or 
incorrect and returns a result of yours.
Details are shown below tables. Don't forget to see these information.
Status	Explanation
WJ	Waiting for Judge. Your source code is waiting for judge by the system. 
Please reload after a while.
CE	Compilation Error. Our judge system couldn't compile your code. So, 
your source code is incorrect.
MLE	Memory Limit Exceeded. Each problems are restricted memory limit which your program can use.
That is 256MB usually. Your source code is incorrect because it exceeded the limit.
TLE	Time Limit Exceeded. Each problems have time limit. 
If execution time of your code exceeds this limit,
the status of judge is TLE. Your source code is incorrect for that reason.
RE	Runtime Error. At least an error occurs while the system is executing your source code.
For example, stack overflow and divided by zero.
These errors are can not detect by compiling. Your source code is incorrect because of the reason.
OLE	Output Limit Exceeded. The data outputted by your code exceeds the designated size of a problem.
Your source code is incorrect.
IE	Internal Error. This is special case because the error almost exits in our judge system.
Anyway, your source code didn't output a result that is expected correct answer.
Your source code is incorrect.
WA	Wrong Answer. Your source code is incorrect. The code has to output correct result for all cases.
AC	Accepted ! Your source code was accepted correctly.
AC is an only status that means Your source code is correct !.

Problem Statement
A binary image is an image consisting of black and white pixels.
You are given a binary image with a height of H pixels and a width of W pixels as pi,j, 
a rectangular array of H×W characters. pi,
jcorresponds to the pixel at the i-th row from the top and j-th column 
from the left in the binary image. 
If pi,j = ., the corresponding pixel is white; if pi,j = #, the corresponding pixel is black.
Additionally, you are also given two integers A and B. 
Your task is to produce a new image with a height of A×H pixels and a width ofB×W pixels, 
by arranging A×B copies of the given image in A rows and B columns.

B - Mixing

Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB
Score : 100 points
Problem Statement
We have N ingredients, numbered 1 through N, used in making medicines. 
We will compound two medicines using these ingredients. 
Each medicine will be made by mixing K ingredients chosen from the N ingredients we have. Here, 
it is not possible to use an ingredient in both medicines at the same time.
There are M rules that decide the efficacy of a medicine. 
The i-th rule is represented by a tuple of three integers (ai,bi,ui).
Based on these rules, the efficacy of a medicine is calculated as below:
•	(efficacy) = (the sum of ui over all i such that both ingredients ai and bi are used in the medicine)
Here, if there does not exist i such that both ingredients ai and bi are used in the medicine, 
the efficacy of the medicine is 0.
Find the maximum possible sum of the efficacies of the two medicines that we will compound.
Constraints
•	All input values are integers.
•	4≤N≤8
•	2≤K≤N⁄2
•	1≤M≤N(N−1)⁄2
•	1≤ai<bi≤N
•	All pairs (ai,bi) are distinct.
•	1≤ui≤100

Time limit : 2sec / Memory limit : 256MB
Score : 100 points
Problem Statement
There is a rectangular board divided into a grid with H rows and W columns. 
Each square of the grid is painted in either black or white. Below, 
we will denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left as (i,j). 
You are given the color of (i,j) as a character ci,j. If ci,j = ., (i,j) is white; 
if ci,j = #, (i,j) is black. Here, (1,1) and (H,W) are always white.
There is a piece placed at (1,1). Your objective is to transfer the piece to (H,W). 
The following two kinds of operations can be used to move the piece:
•	Normal move: Let the square currently occupied by the piece be (y,x). 
Move the piece to one of the following: (y,x+1), (y+1,x),(y,x−1) and (y−1,x). Here, 
the destination may not be a black square or a non-existent square. 
This operation may be executed any number of times.
•	Warp: Let the square currently occupied by the piece be (y,x). 
Move the piece to (y+D,x+R). Here, the values of R and D are predetermined. 
This operation cannot be executed if (y+D,x+R) is black or the square does not exist. 
This operation may be executed at most once (you may choose not to execute this).
Determine whether it is possible to transfer the piece to (H,W). If the transfer is possible, 
find the minimum necessary number of operations (both kinds of operations count).
Constraints
•	2≤H≤10
•	2≤W≤10
•	−(H−1)≤D≤H−1
•	−(W−1)≤R≤W−1
•	The pair (D,R) is different from all of the following: (0,0),(0,1),(1,0),(0,−1) and (−1,0).
•	ci,j is either . or #.
•	c1,1 and cH,W are both ..

Output
If it is possible to transfer the piece to (H,W), print the minimum necessary number of operations.
If it is possible to transfer the piece to (H,W), print -1.

It is possible to transfer the piece from (1,1) to (3,6) in five operations, as follows:
•	Normal move: (1,1)→(1,2)
•	Normal move: (1,2)→(1,3)
•	Warp: (1,3)→(3,4)
•	Normal move: (3,4)→(3,5)
•	Normal move: (3,5)→(3,6)
It is not possible to transfer the piece in fewer operations.

Score : 100 points
Problem Statement
There is a road with a length of L meters that runs east-west, 
and there are N houses built along this road. 
The i-th house from the west is located xi meters east of the west end of the road, 
and there are ri people who live in the house.
A station is going to be built on this road, 
and there was a discussion on the location of the station. 
Let the location of the station be Pmeters east of the west end of the road. 
According to the law, P must be a integer satisfying 0≤P≤L. After the discussion, 
it was decided that the location of the station will be chosen so that 
it minimizes the disutility calculated as follows:
•	(disutility) = (the sum of (|xi−P|×ri) over all i (1≤i≤N))
Here, |a| denotes the absolute value of a.
Find the disutility when the location of the station is chosen to minimize it.
Constraints
•	All input values are integers.
•	1≤L≤1010
•	1≤N≤105
